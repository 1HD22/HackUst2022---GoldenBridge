# Project Title

GoldenBridge

## Theme

6.Social Entrepreneurship

## Description

To assist elderly people in dealing with loneliness issues by allowing NGOs to promote their events on our app. The app is specifically designed
with features for the elderlies, like bigger font and easier navigation.The 2 main features of our app is the events tab and the news tab.
By using a picture only approach, the app is designed to simplify the event joining process as much as possible, while reducing the tension on the
elderlies eyes.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The prototype is designed on Figma.

### Installing

https://www.figma.com/file/a01G7jdJn3i59UN7WgPde9/GoldenBridge?node-id=0%3A1
This link will link the user the Figma website, where the general overview of the app can be seen. (for viewing purpose only)

https://www.figma.com/proto/a01G7jdJn3i59UN7WgPde9/GoldenBridge?node-id=20%3A106&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=20%3A106
The link above links the user to the Figma wabsite, where the prototype can be seen.

### Executing program

# Prototype
1. By clicking the next button in the login page, the user is sent to the main page, where all the events can be seen
2. The user is able to scroll up and down through the events
3. Only the second event of elderlies playing chess works at the moment
4. Clicking on it will lead the user to the details of the event
5. The user is able to click on the image (of the elderlies playing chess) to enlarge it and pan around, clicking on the image a second time minimizes it
6. The user can click the join button to join the event, and be sent back to the main page
7. Swiping left on the main page brings the user to the news section
8. Only the news with the 2 elderlies stretching works here
9. Clicking on the image of the 2 elderlies stretching will bring the user to that particular news (enlarging the image also works)
10. Although the save news button on the top right of the news is clickable, it serves no purpose as of now
11. Simply clicking on the back button on the top right brings the user back to the news page
12. At the news section and the events section, the user can click on the message button at the bottom right to be directed to the messaging section

## Help

Sometimes the swiping to the news part can be difficult because the prototype tends to prefer swiping up instead of left, this is a Figma's limitation
but a straight enough swipe to the left usually solves it

Pressing R on the keyboard resets the prototype back to the first page
